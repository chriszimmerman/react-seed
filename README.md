# react-seed

This repo contains the boilerplate code needed to get a node project using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Code is added to help deploying to [Heroku](https://priceperounce.herokuapp.com/) easier.

# How to run locally
